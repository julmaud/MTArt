# 
# ### Context and Inspiration
# 
# We had the idea of conducting such a project, that can sound a bit original in the beginning, when we met Oriel Ceballos at an art show in Harlem earlier this year. After a successful career as a professor, he decided to take an early exit and started a life as a full time artist, collector and curator. More info on him can be found on his Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/or1el/?hl=fr
# 
# In order to broaden his audience, engage to people and sell his artworks, Oriel regularly - several days per week - go to a subway station in either Manhattan or Brooklyn, displays his artworks and paints live, while engaging with commuters.
# 
# Concerning his station selection process, he would just try stations with traffic and where he would have enough space to display his artworks. However, it rang a bell in our data science-sensitized ears. 
# 
# Let's gather data about subway stations that are relevant to our use case and try to come out with a way for artists to optimally select the subway station that best suits their requirements!!
# 
# ### How to make it into a Data visualization use case? 
# 
# In order to go from our envy and inspiration to a data visualization task, we needed to gather datasets. But before gathering datasets, we needed to know what kind of data we were looking for. In particular, what features of subway stations were relevant to our analysis.
# 
# Here are our hypothesis on the features that matter:
#     
#     Is there a lot of traffic in the station?
#     How easy and convenient is the access to the station?
#     Are the people commuting here interested in Art? 
#     Are they wealthy?
#     
# We are not stating that the best station is the station with most traffic, in a very arty place, and with very reach people. The point here is to be able to discuss those variables in order to find the best match between an artist and a subway station.
# 
# ## Data Sources
# 
# We got our data from different sources: MTA turnstile data, NYC Open Data platform, and by crunching some information manually.
# 
# ### Open Data
#     
# #### Traffic data
# In this task, We started from the great work by Henri Dwyer, that can be found here: https://henri.io/posts/new-york-subway-traffic-data-part-1.html. The original data is here: http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html
# 
# In its final format, for each subway station, it includes the mean daily traffic, as well as the daily traffic for 6 consecutive days in April 2017.
# 
# #### Art galleries
# In order to link a subway station with an appeal for art, we decided to count the number of art galleries in a radius of 0.2 miles around the subway station. This would be a great indicator of the appeal for art in the zone.
# 
# We found the data to do so on NYC OpenData: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/New-York-City-Art-Galleries/tgyc-r5jh/data
# 
# The dataset includes all art galleries in New York, many information on the galleries such as name, telephone.. and the GPS coordinates.
#     
# #### Details of subway stations
# For each station, we needed the GPS coordinates, to link them to the art galleries and the neighborhood, the name of the station and the type of Entrance.
# 
# We found these information on NYC OpenData: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49/data
# 
# 
# ### Manual Data collection
# 
# #### NYC Neighborhoods : Median income & coordinates
# In order to have insights on the wealth of commuters at each station, one indicator is the median income in the neighborhood of the station.
# We found this information on this website: http://statisticalatlas.com/county-subdivision/New-York/New-York-County/Manhattan/Household-Income#figure/neighborhood and scrapped manually. 
# 
# We then collected the GPS coordinates of the centroid of each neighborhood using Google Maps, in order to link each station to the neighborhood of the centroid it is the closest to. 
# 
# 
# ## Data Preprocessing
# 
# ### Data Preparation
# 
# We have had to proceed to the following preprocessing steps:
#     
#     Prepare all GPS coordinates to the same format
#     Transform the traffic data in a usable format. From turnstile events to daily traffic, per station
#     Format all Subway station names - Entity recognition problem - Mapping between datasets
#     Deduplicate the subway stations, in the case where there are different entrances and entrance types
#     
# These steps are not in the following report are they don't include visualization but are available on the girhub repository.
# 
# Below is a snapshot of the different datasets in their preprocessed format, before merging.

# ## Merging the diverse datasets
# 
# The final dataset is a dataset where for each subway station, we have all required information:
#     Name
#     Number of art galleries
#     Median Income
#     Traffic
#     Entrance Type
#     
# Basically, we started with the dataset where each subway station is described. Then:
#     
#     Compute the number of art galleries within 0.2 miles of the station, using GPS Coordinates of the galleries
#     
#     Assign a neighborhood and a median income, using GPS Coordinates of the neighborhood centroids
#     
#     Join the obtained dataset with the dataset containing the traffic data, using a mapping between two different formats for the names of the stations, that we computed using Stemming and Levenstein Distance 

# Note that some stations don't have a neighborhood as we focused on neighborhoods near Manhattan. We only keep those stations afterwards. We also filter out the stations that have less than 2 galleries around, in order to make to visualizations more readable and because those stations are not very interesting based on our assumptions.

# There is not much surprise on the Traffic either. Grand Central, 34th St and 42nd St are known to be the main train stations in Manhattan, with a massive daily traffic. We still see that the slope is pretty high at the top of the ranking, meaning that there are a few stations with a massive traffic and a lot of stations with a more homogeneous traffic, around 50k people per day.

# Based on this plot, we can combine our observations on the traffic and the density of art galleries. Typically the subway stations are polarized along the axis. There are no stations with a massive traffic as well as a large number of galleries. There is mostly a trade off between an arty station and a station with a lot of traffic, except for a few stations such as Canal St or West 4. We will go deeper in the analysis in the charts below.
# 
# However, we have absolute values for both features, which is not optimal for our task of selecting the subway station that would match with an artist, based on their criteria.
# 
# By scaling the variables Number of art galleries and Traffic (retrieveing the mean and dividing by the standard deviation), we will be able to see what stations are more arty than the majority, and which ones have more traffic than the mean!

# ### Number of art galleries vs Traffic - Scaled
# 
# In the following plot, we have scaled the data.
# As a consequence of that, the dot in the upper right part of the graph have more traffic and more galleries than the majority of stations, those in the upper left part have more galleries but less traffic, those in the lower left part have less galleries and less traffic and those in the lower right part have more traffic but less galleries.
#

# As described above and in the legend of the plot, we have defined four groups of art galleries.
# 
# 
# Below is an example of how to read this plot:
# 
# An artist who doesn't want to engage with arty people but wants to reach the larger audience as possible would probably pick a station in the red group, such as 42nd St.
# 
# An artist who wants a lot of traffic as well as engaging with arty people would try a station in the blue group, such as West 4 or Canal St.
# 
# An artist who wants to be in a rather calm station - low traffic - but with arty people may want to go to Spring St or Lexington Av!
# 
# And an artist who wants neither traffic nor arty commuters may pick a station in the yellow group!
# 
# Yet, this plot doesn't talk about the mean income of people living near the station, and thus likely to commute through the station. We will add this feature in the next plot.

# We can now complete our analysis!
# 
# Let's say the artist really wants to sell his artworks and not only display it.
# 
# If he finds himself in the blue group, he may prefer West 4th over Canal St.
# 
# If he chose the red group, he may stay away from Bedford Ave and go to 59th Columbus Circle or 42nd st.
# 
# If the green group took his preference, Lexington Av would be a better option than Prince St for instance!

# #### If the artist says "I only want to showcase my art, not sell it! But it is very heavy and I have broken my ankle, I may need an elevator!"
# 
# This artist should look for the Light Pink dots, in the upper left corner, as he doesn't particularly want to sell.
# 
# We would recommend him to try Lexington Av or 34 St Hudson Yards! 

# ## What next? 
# 
# In the nearest future, build a recommandation algorithm, that would recommand a subway station to an artist, based on its preferences. We would then add this recommandation system to this web app :)
